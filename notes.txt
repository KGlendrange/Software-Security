Task 0:
Imported SCrypt from POM.xml. Its a key derivation function that takes in passphrase, CPU cost(N), blocksize(r), paralellization(p). With these parameters we can intentionally make the password time or memory dependant, not enough to where normal users would notice it, but enough to where malicious attackers would have to spend a lot of resources. 

Divided User into Username and Password and can easily change settings on what we allow, following the NIST requirements to where its safe, but not too annoying for the users.

Setting HttpsOnly and secureflag to Cookie, doesn't help much right now as we dont have a HTTPS certificate. 

Task 1:
Remade all SQL queries into safe PreparedStatements, even where it doesn't take user input because it doesnt hurt. 

Task 3:
Escaping malicious characters such as replacing the character < with &lt, which still displays it as a <. This prevents the user from injecting code.

Task 3: 
Made CSRF tokens from the unguessable session ids, forms that doesn't require any other id like eventid has to pass a CSRF token check!

Task 4:
Created a column in the AccountChannel database from accountStorage that saves Roles. Made a setRole function only accessable to "owner" roles, that takes can set any user to any role.
Restricted other functions like Edit,Post,Delete,and Join depending on what role you have.
